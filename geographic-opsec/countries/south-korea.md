# South Korea - Surveillance & OPSEC

## Threat Classification: **TIER 1-2** (Moderate Surveillance, Strong Privacy Laws, but National Security Trump Card)

**Unique Factors:**
- Democracy with strong privacy protections (Personal Information Protection Act)
- BUT: National Security Act allows broad surveillance (North Korea threat)
- Advanced tech infrastructure (world's fastest internet, 5G coverage)

---

## I. Legal Framework

**Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA, 2011):**
- GDPR-like protections
- Consent required for data collection
- Right to deletion, portability

**National Security Act (1948):**
```
Provision:
- Broad powers to monitor "pro-North Korea" activity
- Vague definition = can target activists, journalists
- Telecommunications intercept allowed (court order typically required)
```

**Telecommunications Business Act:**
- ISPs must retain data (1 year)
- Real-name registration for phone, internet (since 2000s)

---

## II. Surveillance Infrastructure

### 2.1 Real-Name Registration

**Internet:**
- Website registration requires real name + resident registration number (RRN)
- Abolished for social media (2012 ruling), but some sites still require

**Mobile:**
- SIM card: Mandatory RRN (equivalent to SSN)
- Foreigners: Passport + visa required
- Burner SIMs: Difficult (all tracked)

**OPSEC Implication:** High attribution (all activity linkable to identity)

---

### 2.2 Internet Censorship

**Blocked Content:**
- North Korean websites (state.gov.kp, etc.)
- Pro-DPRK content
- Some adult content
- Gambling sites

**Method:**
- DNS/IP blocking (ISP-level)
- Bypass: VPN, Tor (legal, widely used)

**Attribution Weight:** AW = 0.60 (MEDIUM - can be bypassed easily)

---

## III. Financial Surveillance

**Cryptocurrency:**
- Legal, heavily regulated
- KYC mandatory for exchanges (Upbit, Bithumb)
- Real-name bank account required to trade
- Tax: 20% on gains > ₩2.5M (~$2,000 USD)

**Banking:**
- All accounts linked to RRN
- International transfers monitored (anti-money laundering)

**OPSEC:**
```
- Cryptocurrency fully traceable (RRN linkage)
- Use P2P for privacy (but volume low in Korea)
- Cash still king for anonymity
```

---

## IV. Physical Security

### CCTV Coverage

**Seoul:**
- 80,000+ CCTV cameras (public + private)
- Subway stations: Extensive coverage
- Facial recognition: Limited deployment (privacy concerns)

**Privacy Protections:**
- CCTV footage: 30-day retention typically
- Access: Requires legal justification

---

## V. North Korea Context

**Unique Threat:**
- North Korean cyber operations (Lazarus Group)
- Spear-phishing South Korean targets
- Defector surveillance

**OPSEC for Defectors/Activists:**
```
- Assume DPRK monitoring
- Device security critical (state-sponsored malware)
- Physical security (DPRK agents in South Korea)
- Signal with disappearing messages
```

---

## VI. Operational Recommendations

**DO:**
```
- VPN for bypassing censorship (legal)
- Tor for anonymity (not explicitly illegal)
- Cash for untraceable transactions
- Be aware of National Security Act (avoid pro-DPRK content)
```

**DON'T:**
```
- Expect burner SIMs (RRN requirement = high barrier)
- Criticize government during protests without understanding NSA risk
- Assume cryptocurrency is private (RRN linkage)
```

**Attribution Weight:** AW = 0.65 (MEDIUM-HIGH)
