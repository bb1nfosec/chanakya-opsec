# Japan - Surveillance & OPSEC

## Threat Classification: **TIER 1** (Limited Surveillance, Strong Privacy Culture, But Expanding Capabilities)

**Key Factors:**
- Historically low surveillance (privacy-conscious culture)
- Recent expansions: Anti-Conspiracy Law (2017), Wire-Tapping Law amendments
- Close cooperation with USA (NSA sharing)
- Advanced cyber capabilities (Defense Intelligence Headquarters - DIH)

---

## I. Legal Framework

### 1.1 Privacy Protections

**Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI, 2003, amended 2020):**
```
- Similar to GDPR  
- Consent required for data collection
- Right to deletion, correction
- Cross-border data transfer restrictions
```

**No Mass Surveillance Law:**
- Unlike Five Eyes (USA, UK, Australia)
- No blanket telecommunications intercept
- Targeted surveillance requires court orders

---

### 1.2 Anti-Conspiracy Law (2017)

**Controversial Provisions:**
- Expands surveillance for "organized crime prevention"
- Includes "preparation" for crimes (not just execution)
- Critics: Vague definitions, potential for abuse
- Allows increased wire-tapping for designated crimes

**OPSEC Relevance:** Low for most users, high for activists

---

## II. Surveillance Infrastructure

### 2.1 Intelligence Agencies

**Public Security Intelligence Agency (PSIA):**
- Domestic surveillance (counterintelligence, extremism)
- Limited SIGINT capabilities (compared to NSA)

**Defense Intelligence Headquarters (DIH):**
- Military intelligence
- Cyber operations
- Cooperation with NSA (Yokota Air Base, Misawa AB have NSA presence)

---

### 2.2 Telecommunications

**SIM Registration:**
- Not mandatory (unlike China, India)
- Prepaid SIMs available without ID (MNVO carriers)
- OPSEC: Easy to obtain burner SIMs

**Data Retention:**
- No mandatory ISP data retention law (as of 2026)
- Individual court orders for specific intercepts
- Much less invasive than Australia/EU

**Attribution Weight:** AW = 0.40 (LOW-MEDIUM)

---

## III. Internet Freedom

**Censorship:**
- Minimal (child abuse material only)
- No Great Firewall
- Tor, VPNs legal and unrestricted

**Social Media Monitoring:**
- Police monitor for threats, but limited scale
- No systematic mass surveillance

---

## IV. Financial Privacy

**Cash Culture:**
- Japan still heavily cash-based
- Large cash transactions common, less scrutiny than West
- ATMs: Convenience stores, 24/7 access

**Cryptocurrency:**
- Legal since 2017 (Payment Services Act)
- Exchanges require KYC (bitFlyer, Coincheck)
- Tax: Income tax on gains (can be 55% at top bracket)

**OPSEC:**
```
- Cash preferred for anonymity
- Crypto: Use P2P, avoid exchanges
```

---

## V. Physical Security

**CCTV:**
- Present in Tokyo, but less pervasive than London/Beijing
- Facial recognition: Limited deployment (privacy concerns)
- Police: Koban system (local police boxes, community policing)

---

## VI. Border Crossings

**Entry:**
- Fingerprint + photo for foreigners (since 2007)
- Japanese citizens exempt from biometrics
- Device searches: Rare (unlike USA/Australia)

**OPSEC:** Low-risk compared to Five Eyes countries

---

## VII. Operational Recommendations

**DO:**
```
- Use prepaid SIM (no ID required)
- Cash for transactions (widely accepted)
- VPN/Tor (legal, unrestricted)
- Encrypted messaging (Signal, Threema)
```

**DON'T:**
```
- Assume zero surveillance (USA shares intel via Yokota/Misawa bases)
- Ignore Anti-Conspiracy Law if activist (potential targeting)
- Use Japanese crypto exchanges if privacy critical (KYC requirement)
```

**Attribution Weight:** AW = 0.45 (MEDIUM)

---

## VIII. Comparison to Neighbors

| Country | Surveillance | Data Retention | SIM ID Required | AW |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Japan** | Low | None (systematic) | No | 0.45 |
| **South Korea** | Medium | 1 year | Yes (RRN) | 0.65 |
| **China** | Extreme | Permanent | Yes (Real-name) | 1.00 |
