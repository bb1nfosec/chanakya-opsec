**CHANAKYA** is not an OPSEC checklist.  
**CHANAKYA** is not a compliance framework.  
**CHANAKYA** is not a product.

CHANAKYA is a research framework for understanding **how operational security fails through emergent signal correlation across abstraction layers**.

---

## The Problem

Modern OPSEC guidance focuses on isolated controls:
- "Use Tor"
- "Encrypt everything"
- "Disable JavaScript"
- "Use VPNs"

This is **checklist thinking**. It fails because:

1. **OPSEC failures are emergent** — weak signals across layers correlate to create strong attribution.
2. **Detection happens holistically** — adversaries don't analyze DNS *or* routing *or* timing. They analyze DNS *and* routing *and* timing *and* metadata.
3. **"Best practices" encode assumptions** — those assumptions leak through their absence or presence.
4. **Encryption hides content, not context** — and context is often sufficient for attribution.

**Reality**: Nation-state adversaries and sophisticated threat hunters don't rely on single indicators. They build **correlation graphs** across:
- Network plane (BGP, AS-path, anycast behavior)
- DNS plane (resolver chains, sinkhole patterns, recursion leakage)
- Userland signals (TLS fingerprints, binary entropy, timezone leaks)
- Kernel-adjacent observables (syscall patterns, timing jitter)
- Metadata & temporal patterns (activity cadence, update rhythms, human habits)

When two weak signals correlate, **OPSEC is already broken**.

## What CHANAKYA Does

CHANAKYA provides:

### 1. **Multi-Layer Signal Modeling**
Framework components for analyzing OPSEC failures across:
- **Userland**: Process behavior, binary fingerprints, environment leakage, application-layer signals
- **Kernel-Adjacent**: Observable side-effects without root (syscall patterns, timing, entropy sources)
- **DNS**: Resolver correlation, sinkhole detection, passive DNS reconstruction, split-horizon failures
- **Routing & Network Plane**: AS-path exposure, BGP asymmetry, traffic localization, MTU fingerprinting
- **Metadata & Temporal**: Activity patterns, timing fingerprints, operational habits

### 2. **Correlation Engine**
Models how weak signals across layers combine to create attribution:
- Cross-layer correlation detection
- Risk scoring based on signal intersection
- Detection probability modeling
- Deniability assessment

### 3. **Failure Scenario Simulations**
Demonstrates how real-world OPSEC configurations fail:
- DNS sinkhole attribution
- Routing asymmetry correlation
- Temporal pattern fingerprinting
- Environment leak chaining

### 4. **Strategic Documentation**
Not "how to be secure" — but "why security fails":
- OPSEC failure taxonomy
- Threat models based on adversary capabilities (not vendor marketing)
- Real-world case analysis
- Layer correlation methodologies

### 5. **AI-Era 2026 Enhancements** 🤖

**New**: Addressing AI/ML-augmented attribution threats:
- **AI-Augmented Attribution**: How Graph ML, LSTMs, and LLMs enable retrospective attribution
- **Quantitative Signal Scoring**: Mathematical framework for attribution weight calculation (V × R × C formula)
- **Retrospective Attribution Simulation**: Demonstrating how "safe" signals become dangerous years later
- **Kernel-Adjacent Analysis**: Syscall patterns, timing side-channels, workload classification
- **Behavioral Entropy Quantification**: Shannon entropy (H > 3.5 bits target) for unpredictability measurement
- **Counter-AI OPSEC**: Defensive techniques specifically designed against ML correlation

**Key Differentiator**: Only OPSEC framework addressing AI-era attribution explicitly with rigorous quantification.

### 6. **Multi-INT Intelligence Layers** 🌐🔍📡🗺️👥🔬

**New**: Comprehensive intelligence discipline analysis:

**🌐 Browser Layer**
- WebRTC IP leaks (CRITICAL - bypasses VPN/Tor)
- Canvas/WebGL fingerprinting (99.9% unique)
- Font enumeration, extension detection
- JavaScript timing attacks

**🔍 OSINT Layer**
- GitHub/GitLab metadata mining & commit timing correlation
- LinkedIn team structure inference
- Domain WHOIS correlation & passive DNS
- Conference attendance tracking
- Social media timing analysis

**📡 SIGINT Layer**
- Encrypted traffic analysis (despite TLS/VPN)
- Cellular network correlation (IMSI catchers)
- Tor flow correlation
- Protocol fingerprinting

**🗺️ GEOINT Layer**
- Multi-source timezone triangulation (Bayesian fusion)
- IP geolocation → satellite imagery correlation
- Cell tower triangulation
- Travel pattern analysis
- Physical infrastructure identification

**👥 HUMINT Layer**
- Behavioral profiling (work/life patterns)
- Language/cultural indicators in code
- Social engineering attack surface
- Conference badge photos → identity revelation
- Team structure analysis

**🔬 Forensics Layer**
- Filesystem forensics (MAC times, deleted file recovery)
- Memory forensics (RAM artifacts)
- Browser forensics (history, cookies)
- Network forensics (PCAP analysis)
- Metadata forensics (EXIF, document metadata)
- Timeline reconstruction

**Cross-INT Fusion**: Multi-discipline signal correlation (e.g., OSINT + GEOINT + HUMINT → full attribution)

**Key Innovation**: ONLY framework modeling realistic all-source intelligence fusion.

## Philosophy

CHANAKYA operates on these principles:

### **Adversarial Deniability Over Compliance**
The goal is not "follow standards" — it's "create ambiguity and misattribution."

### **Correlation Is Detection**
If two independent signals can be correlated to the same operation, OPSEC has failed.

### **Trust Nothing, Verify Leakage**
Every layer leaks. The question is not "if" but "what" and "how much."

### **Routing and DNS Are First-Class OPSEC Layers**
Most OPSEC guidance treats network infrastructure as solved. It's not. DNS and routing are where most sophisticated attribution happens.

### **Temporal Patterns Are Fingerprints**
Human habits leak through operational timing. Activity cadence, update patterns, and temporal correlation destroy anonymity.

### **No Kernel Exploitation, Only Observable Effects**
CHANAKYA focuses on side-channel observables that don't require root or kernel modules — the signals hiding in plain sight.

## Who This Is For

CHANAKYA assumes you already know:
- MITRE ATT&CK
- OWASP threat modeling
- Basic OPSEC principles
- Network fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, BGP)
- Unix/Linux userland and kernel concepts

This framework is for:
- **Red team operators** who need to understand how their infrastructure leaks
- **Threat hunters** who want to detect adversaries through weak signal correlation
- **Security researchers** studying attribution techniques
- **Intelligence analysts** modeling nation-state detection capabilities
- **Engineers building high-stakes systems** where OPSEC failure has real consequences

If you're looking for a scanner or a compliance tool, **this is not for you**.
